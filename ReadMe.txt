WHAT IS FACE VERIFICATION SDK?
======================================
The Face Verification SDK is designed for integration of facial authentication into enterprise and consumer applications for mobile devices and PCs. 
The simple API of the library component helps to implement solutions like payment, e-services and all other applications that need enhanced security 
through biometric face recognition, while keeping their overall size small for easy deployment to millions of users.
Different liveness detection functionalities are included to implement anti-spoofing mechanism with the possibility of configuring the balance 
between security and usability of the application.
The Face Verification SDK is intended for developing applications which perform end-user identity verification in mass scale systems like:
* online banking and e-shops;
* government e-services;
* social networks and media sharing services.
The Face Verification SDK uses simplified client-cloud licensing model. Face image is captured and template created or verified on a client side 
(eg. using mobile device's camera or a laptop camera). Application communicates with the cloud service to check available licenses. 
When compared to other Neurotechnology products, user do not call any license obtain functions. An application based on Face Verification SDK technology 
checks available licenses when user creates face template.

Face Verification is available as SDK for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS and iOS platforms.
